# Muhammad Arif bin Fazil — Geoscientist & AI Governance Architect

> Personal site of Arif Fazil: geologist, economist, and architect of arifOS — a thermodynamic constitutional governance framework for lawful, audited AI systems.

Muhammad Arif bin Fazil (Arif) is a Malaysian geoscientist, economist, and software architect who bridges deep geological time with computational governance. Trained as a Petronas Scholar (Penang, 1990), Arif's work applies thermodynamic principles from subsurface systems to AI accountability, creating arifOS — a constitutional kernel that enforces truth, reversibility, and human sovereignty over artificial intelligence.

This site documents the intersection of geology, thermodynamics, and AI governance.
