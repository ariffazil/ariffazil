  ### 🜂 My Story

  I spent **11 years as an exploration geoscientist at PETRONAS** — reading the memory of the earth, refusing to drill without evidence. 
  100% exploration success rate. Every well I helped mature found hydrocarbons.

  Then my father died the same day my well struck oil. I saw that the institution would consume my talent while ignoring my humanity. I  
  left.

  Now I build **arifOS** — a constitutional kernel that teaches machines the one thing they never had: *law*. Not hype. Not rebellion.   
  Just a refusal to let chaos wear a clever face.

  I stopped chasing "smarter AI" and started asking: **what keeps it honest?**

  ### 🏛️ What I Build

  **[arifOS](https://github.com/ariffazil/arifOS)** — A constitutional AI governance framework with 13 immutable floors and three        
  independent judges (Mind · Heart · Soul).

  It enforces floors across truth, clarity, empathy, humility, peace, integrity, and more — from F1 Amanah (trust) through F13 Curiosity 
  (exploratory freedom). Every action is audited. Every verdict is sealed.

  **Live:** [arif-fazil.com](https://arif-fazil.com) · **Docs:** [arif-fazil.com/arifos](https://arif-fazil.com/arifos) · **License:**   
  AGPL-3.0

  Every other project I touch — SEA-LION integrations, toxic-guard rails, agentic coders — they all orbit **arifOS**. The kernel is the  
  law; everything else is application.

  ### ⚖️ Focus

  | Axis | From | I Learned To See |
  |------|------|------------------|
  | **Δ — Physics / Clarity** | Geology | Systems are shaped by pressure, entropy, time. |
  | **Ω — Meaning / Empathy** | Economics | Incentives reveal truth slower than greed hides it. |
  | **Ψ — Governance / Stability** | Architecture | Intelligence must be audited, not believed. |

  **Focus areas:**
  - Thermodynamic AI Governance (ΔΩΨ Physics)
  - Constitutional AI & Lawful Agents
  - Systems Architecture across Physics · Meaning · Power
  - Southeast Asia AI ecosystem & ethical infrastructure
