### 🜂 My Story

I started in **geology** — learning how pressure shapes rock, how time makes truth visible.  
Then **economics** taught me the same laws apply to people: incentives carve mountains into markets.  
Now I build **arifOS** — a constitutional kernel that teaches machines the one thing they never had: *law*.

I’ve seen how intelligence without governance collapses — in systems, companies, even in ourselves.  
So I stopped chasing “smarter AI” and started asking: **what keeps it honest?**

That’s what arifOS is — a cooling layer between power and consequence.  
Not hype. Not rebellion. Just a refusal to let chaos wear a clever face.

### 🏛️ What I Build

**[arifOS](https://github.com/ariffazil/arifOS)** — A ΔΩΨ-governed constitutional kernel for AI agents.  
It enforces nine immutable floors: Truth, Clarity (ΔS ≥ 0), Peace², Empathy (κᵣ ≥ 0.95), Humility (Ω₀ ≈ 3–5 %), Integrity (Amanah = LOCK), RASA, Tri-Witness, and Anti-Hantu.  

Every other project I touch — SEA-LION integrations, toxic-guard rails, agentic coders —  
they all orbit **arifOS**. The kernel is the law; everything else is application.

### ⚖️ Focus

| Axis | From | I Learned To See |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Δ — Physics / Clarity** | Geology | Systems are shaped by pressure, entropy, time. |
| **Ω — Meaning / Empathy** | Economics | Incentives reveal truth slower than greed hides it. |
| **Ψ — Governance / Stability** | Architecture | Intelligence must be audited, not believed. |

**Focus areas:**
- Thermodynamic AI Governance (ΔΩΨ Physics)  
- Constitutional AI & Lawful Agents  
- Systems Architecture across Physics · Meaning · Power  
- Southeast Asia AI ecosystem & ethical infrastructure
