  ### About

  Exploration geoscientist at **PETRONAS** with a dual background in geology and economics (University of Wisconsin-Madison). I read     
  subsurface data for a living — interpreting what the earth remembers so we drill where the evidence points, not where intuition        
  guesses.

  Outside the office, I build **AI governance systems** — constitutional frameworks that force language models to admit uncertainty,     
  audit their own reasoning, and defer to human authority. I think the hardest problem in AI isn't intelligence. It's accountability.

  ### What I Work On

  - **AI Governance & Constitutional Frameworks** — Enforcement layers that sit between LLMs and users, ensuring truth, empathy, and     
  reversibility before any action is sealed.
  - **Exploration Geoscience** — Subsurface interpretation, frontier basin studies, fractured basement plays, and prospect maturation    
  across Southeast Asia.
  - **Systems Thinking** — Applying thermodynamic and geological reasoning (pressure, entropy, time) to AI architecture and decision     
  systems.

  ### Focus Areas

  | Domain | Lens |
  |--------|------|
  | Constitutional AI | Governance > persuasion. Machines need law, not alignment theater. |
  | Thermodynamic Systems | Intelligence generates heat. Governance is the cooling function. |
  | Geoscience & Energy | The earth doesn't lie — but you have to know how to read it. |
  | Southeast Asia Tech | Building ethical AI infrastructure where it's needed most. |

  ### Principles

  - Unknown is better than unsafe certainty.
  - A system that cannot refuse cannot be trusted.
  - Intelligence must be audited, not believed.
  - Power is burden, not privilege.
