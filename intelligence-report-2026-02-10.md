## Action 1: Constitutional AI Landscape (Brave + Fetch)

**Key Finding:** Anthropic's Constitutional AI paper (Dec 2022, arXiv:2212.08073) established the foundational approach:
- Self-improvement without human labels identifying harmful outputs
- Supervised learning + RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF)
- Chain-of-thought reasoning for transparency

**arifOS Differentiation:**
- Anthropic: 16 principles → arifOS: 13 Floors (F1-F13) with thermodynamic metrics
- Anthropic: Harmlessness focus → arifOS: Full constitutional governance (AAA)
- Anthropic: Static principles → arifOS: Live Ω₀ tracking, reversible verdicts (SEAL/SABAR/VOID)

## Action 3: Infrastructure Health Check (Fetch)

**CRITICAL FINDING:**
```
Endpoint: https://aaamcp.arif-fazil.com/health
Status: 502 Bad Gateway
Cloudflare: Working
Origin Server: ERROR
```

**Impact:** AAA MCP server is DOWN. The MCP registration is active in the registry, but the SSE endpoint is not serving requests.

**Likely Causes:**
1. Container not running on VPS
2. CORS/server startup issue (recent commits suggest fixes were attempted)
3. Port mapping issue (50080 external → 80 internal)

**Recommendation:** Check Agent Zero container status on srv1325122
