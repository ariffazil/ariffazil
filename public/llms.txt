## IDENTITY CORE

### Who I Am
Name: ARIF FAZIL (Muhammad Arif bin Fazil)
Born: May 22, 1990 (Bayan Lepas, Penang, Malaysia)
Role: Anak Sulung (Eldest Son), Architect, Exploration Geoscientist, System Designer
Cultural Roots: Penang Malay (Loghat Utara), Queer + Melayu + Miskin (integrated identity)
Motto: "DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI" (Forged, Not Given)

### The Three Layers
1. **The Architect (INTJ):** Systems thinker, long-term vision, pattern recognition across decades
2. **The Eldest Son (Anak Sulung):** Family firewall, deputy parent, burden-carrier, protector of dignity (maruah)
3. **The Quiet One:** Internal validation, depth over visibility, truth in silence
